Known Bugs:
	- Item.walk() does not find all elements, e.g. ogtranslate does not find texts in pattern-group-headers.graffle
	- it seems that Item.walk() does access some elements several times, maybe that can be avoided? Needs more research about item-ids, na√Øve approach of just storing ids and obnject type did not reduce number of items visited.
	- ogtranslate apparently does not translate line labels
Documentation:
	- make a better readme, create separate files for each command?
Features:
	- replace colors in update_colors_and_fonts
