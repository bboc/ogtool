Known Bugs:
  - Item.walk() does not find all elements, e.g. ogtranslate does not find texts in pattern-group-headers.graffle
  - it seems that Item.walk() does access some elements several times, maybe that can be avoided? Needs more research about item-ids, na√Øve approach of just storing ids and oject type did not reduce number of items visited.
